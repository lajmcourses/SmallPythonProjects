# Exercise 1: Pig Latin

Pig Latin is a children secret language:

1) If the word begins with vowel (a, e, i, o, u), add "way" to the end of the word

2) If the word begins with any other character, put it to the end of the word and add "ay".

Translate from Pig Latin into English:

   bus

   airplane

   computer

   "Hello, world!"

   "I code in Python."

   "Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast."

# Exercise 2: Ubbi Dubbi

Ubbi Dubbi is another secret language, even easier than Pig Latin.

Every vowel (a, e, i, o, u) if prefaced with "ub", so "python" becomes "pythubon", and "milk" becomes "mubilk".

Write a program that translates from English to Ubbi Dubbi, and translate:

   bus
   airplane
   computer
   "Hello, world!"
   "I code in Python."
   "Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast."

Output translation to file: ubbi_dubbi.txt. Use the following format:

    - on the first line is the original word;
    - on the second line is the translation;
    - the third line is empty.
