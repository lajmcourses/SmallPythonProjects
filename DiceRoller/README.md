Dice are small throwable objects with marked sides that can rest in multiple positions.
Dice are used in board and role-playing games. In mathematics dice are used as random
number generators. To roll the dice means to take a chance, to take risk in the hopes
of a fortunate result or gain.


## Assingment 1:

a) Write a function that simulates a coin flip. The probability of each coin side to show up is 1/2.

b) Write a program that simulates tossing of three coins. Let's assume that the score is equal to 1 when
heads show up, and 0 - when tails show up. Output the score on each coin, and the resulting sum on all three
coins.

c) Write a program that simulates 20 coin tosses. Save the coin toss results to the csv file. 
How many times each side of the coin showed up?

## Assignment 2:

a) Write a function that simulates a six-sided dice roll. The probability of each side to show is 1/6. 

b) Write a program that simulates rolling of three six-sided dice. Output the score on each die, and the
resulting sum on all three dice.

c) Write a program that simulates 30 dice rolls. Save the dice rolling results to the csv file. 
How many times each side of the die showed up?
